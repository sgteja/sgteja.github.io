  # code: https://github.com/crowddj/crowddj-react
  description: The project is about reconstructing a whole 3D scene and simultaneously obtaining camera poses from a set of images taken by a monocular camera at different locations and poses of a scene. The problem here is often referred as Structure from Motion (SFM).

- title: Learning SfM, an Unsupervised way
  demo:  http://sgteja.github.io/trailsite.github.io/reports/SFM_deep.pdf
  description: An unsupervised learning approach for predicting the monocular depth and ego-motion from the video sequences. We try to improve the end-to-end learning approach presented in <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46023/" target="_blank">SfMLearner</a>. In contrast to original SfMLearner our training data is limited to a subset of the original KITTI dataset. We used ResNet architecture for depth estimation, with SSIM and forward-backward consistency loss which is adapted from this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02276" target="_blank">GeoNet</a>. The evaluations and comparision show the effectiveness of our approach, which improves the abs_rel depth metric of SfMLearner by about 18%.

- title: Face Swap
  demo: http://sgteja.github.io/trailsite.github.io/reports/FaceSwap.pdf
  description: An end-to-end pipeline of swapping two faces in a video was performed by using both classical (Dlib library) and deep-learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07835" target="_blank">PRNet</a>) methods for getting facial fiducials. The Face Swap was performed in two scenarios one being between two faces in the same video and the other a face in a video with a face in a given image. The resulting videos can be seen in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TWO6Hed_34k3yZWGM-GOuf4xCKWST9Er?usp=sharing" target="_blank">folder</a>.

- title: Panorama Stitching
  demo: http://sgteja.github.io/trailsite.github.io/reports/Pano.pdf
  description: In this project two or more images are stitched together into one seamless panorama image. The estimation of homography between the images was done in both classical (harris corners, RANSAC) and deep-learning methods (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03798.pdf" target="_blank">HomographyNet</a>). The deep-learning approach had both supervised (HomographyNet) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03966" target="_blank">unsupervised</a> methods. But the deep-learning methods were able to provide good results on the synthetic data but not between two images to be stitched. So we went ahead with stitching of images using classical approach.

#   description: A simple weather app I made at HubSpot's Fall 2016 Web App Workshop utilizing Node.js, Express, and Heroku. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather and forecast data, and then used the current city's coordinates to create a map background that reflected the current city using the Google Maps API.

#   description: ScreenTime 2.0 was one of <a href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>'s most important consumer-facing software updates on <a href="https://starry.com/station" target="_blank">Starry Station</a>, providing new functionality for users to easily filter content, pause the internet, and even create custom rules for blocking apps like Facebook and Twitter right from their mobile phones. As a co-op, I played a large role in the implementation of this feature on Starry's cordova android app, and was responsible for building out front-end designs, linking up back-end data, as well as communicating with designers and other engineers throughout the process. <br><br> Check out the Starry App on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starry.management" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, and learn more about ScreenTime 2.0 on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/screentime-for-starry-station" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a> and the <a href="https://blog.starry.com/whats-new-screentime-just-got-better-for-parents/" target="_blank">Starry Blog</a>.

#   description: This is just an online version of my resume I made for fun. I was interested in learning React.js, so I found this <a href="https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/building-your-first-react-js-app-d53b0c98dc#.1439cdewq">simple tutorial</a> and it kind of spun into this weekend project. I probably didn't need to use React at all, but hey, at least I learned a few things!

#   description: At MullenLowe, I helped build this 2015 holiday site around an algorithm that generated a holiday greeting to each and every person on the planet. We also accounted for newcomers being added at an amazing rate. Overall, the website is a tranquil, animated experience. As new names appear, visitors can watch them fall, like snowflakes, onto a stylized world map. Users can also find their own name and see it as part of the world collective. Check out this short <a href="http://us.mullenlowe.com/work/one-card-for-all/" target="_blank">video</a> describing the project!
